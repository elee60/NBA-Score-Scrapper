NBA SCORE SCRAPPER: A TALENT EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS TOOL
CS 211-002 GROUP 23 (PROF. MENGISTU)
Kunal Khurana (Project Leader), Khai Nguyen, Logan France, Emma Lee

The goal of this project was to devise a software application capable of quantitatively assessing and comparing the talent of an NBA roster. 
Performance data of the top 100 players in the league was compiled into an excel spreadsheet and then converted to txt format. 
Data was "read" into the program via the TextReader class and then processed in four different classes, depending on the specific type of analysis being performed. 
Two abstract classes, Comparator and Evaluator, were constructed. These two abstract classes were extended by 4 concrete classes:
TeamComparator, PlayerComparator, TeamEvaluator, and PlayerEvaluator, which implement an inherited abstract method. 
The abstract method is either evaluate() or compare() (see "Inheritance Hierarchy" PDF). 
The implementation of these abstract methods provide return types that are either Strings or ArrayLists for display. 
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was constructed to display the data in a visually appealing way. 
The author of each document is listed at the very top of the text file when you click on it.

Note to Dr. Mengistu: If you would like to test out our code to get an idea of what kind of output some of our methods produce, open the following java files. 
Make sure the txt file containing the player data is in the same directory.

TextReader.java
Comparator.java
TeamComparator.java
PlayerComparator.java

In the interactions pane, type the following code and press enter:
PlayerComparator p = new PlayerComparator();
p.compare("Lebron James", "Anthony Davis", "PPG");
You should get the output: 

Lebron James averages more PPG than Anthony Davis.

Then, type: 
TeamComparator t = new TeamComparator();
t.compare("Milwaukee Bucks", "Los Angeles Lakers");
You should get the output:

Likelihood of Winning
-----------------------------
Milwaukee Bucks: 46 %
Los Angeles Lakers: 54 %
The Los Angeles Lakers are favored to win by 8 %.>
